# 05.Sending Responses

We can send responses back to the client on the webpage, by using the res parameter of the server as such

```jsx
const server = http.createServer((req,res)=>{
	conosle.log(req.url,req.method,req.headers)
	res.setHeader('Content-Type','text/html')
	res.write('<html>')
	res.write('<head><title>My First Page</title><head>')
	res.write('<body><h1>Hello from my NodeJS Server!</h1></body>')
	res.write('</html>')
	res.end();
	//res.write() can't be used after we used res.end() since the response has stopped else it will result in an error
})
```

We use `res.setHeader()`  to let the browser know what sort of content we are returning, since we are returning HTML , we set the content type header as text/html (may be implicitly set by browser)

We then proceed to send the HTML content line by line using the `res.write()` method, there is a better way to do this, which we will learn later

We then indicate to the browser that the html content has ended by using a `res.end()` and the browser will not accept any `res.write()` after that (woudl result in an error)
