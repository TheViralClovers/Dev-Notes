The request body may be sent in parts

We can work with buffers to parse each part one by one and work with the chunks of data early instead of waiting for the whole body to come through

We can implement buffers by using the `req.on()` listener and set it to listen for  `'data'` and passing in an anonymous arrow function to access the chunks as this

```jsx
const body = [];
    req.on('data', (chunk) => {
      console.log(chunk);
      body.push(chunk);
    });
```

here we created an empy array to store the chunks we may get, now to merge the chunks, we use another listener to listen for the end of the request body `req.on('end')`

```jsx
req.on('end', () => {
      const parsedBody = Buffer.concat(body).toString();
      const message = parsedBody.split('=')[1]; //message=usermessage we split this and extract
      fs.writeFileSync('message.txt', message);
    });
```

We use a built in method to combien all the chunks in the body array to one, then we convert that to a string and we extract the part we need by using the String split method and then we finally write that message to `message.txt` file 

Buffer and ParsedBody look like this

We get in the fomrat `message=fasdfasdf` because, we sent this through a POST request, which sent the data as a key value pair automatically from the form on `/`
